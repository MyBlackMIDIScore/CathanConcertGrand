Welcome to the .Assets folder! It contains the heart of the Cathan Concert Grand.

In the "Include" folder you will find the base SFZ configurations for the piano, strings and damper sounds,
  as well as all curved values (release, pan, volume, attack, filter), which are used in the SoundFont's
  main SFZ instrument files. Please only edit these files if you know what you are doing and always create
  a backup of them before modifying them. All SFZ configurations found here are licensed under the GPLv2
  license, just like all other SFZ files.

In the "Samples" folder you will find all the audio samples for the piano. Any modifications to the samples
  are not allowed, as they are licensed under the CC BY-ND 4.0 license.
