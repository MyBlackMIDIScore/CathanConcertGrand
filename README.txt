The Cathan Concert Grand is a high quality piano soundfont based on the Maestro Concert Grand library made by Mats Helgesson, sampled from a Yamaha CFIII Concert Grand Piano. A selection of the original samples were modified to achieve the iconic sound of Cathan Concert Grand. Its clean and strong sound together with the custom reverb applied create a pleasant sound experience on both Black MIDI playback and normal piano performances. The Cathan Concert Grand includes 20 dynamic velocity layers for a realistic response and comes in SFZ format with the samples being in uncompressed 16-bit WAV format.
